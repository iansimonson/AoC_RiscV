# Advent of Code in RISC-V

Code for both a 64-bit linux riscv system (fedora linux risc-v) as well as code for an esp32c3

The esp32c3 downloads the input with C code provided by espressif becuase that would be
insane to have to do just to learn riscv.

The linux environment just reads in the input from a file. I'll probably start
with code that works on both systems _but_ then move on to taking advantage
of extra instructions on the linux system

Esp32c3 build uses the [esp-idf](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html) environment

I left the .devcontainer the esp-idf plugin autogenerated in case that's helpful but I'm not familiar with it

To build change into the esp32c3 directory and go through setup:

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32c3
idf.py menuconfig # change the wifi ssid/password
idf.py build
```

If you forgot to override the wifi in menuconfig or didn't run that you can just change `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SSID` and `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_PASSWORD` in the generated `sdkconfig` file

Also add your AOC token with `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_AOC_TOKEN`

The linux code I compile on QEMU directly so just use normal gcc/cmake there
